#IMOPRTANT POINTS#

#REQUIREMENTS#
1. You need a form in Google Forms and which must be publicly available for responses.
2. The form fields are not necessarily be of specific format rather only text type fields will be fine for all kind of form field types of html even for dropdowns etc.
3. You need to find the field ID in code of google form and match with the form html in your shopify page, only then the values will be accepted by Google.


=> You can view your form submissions from shopify in Google Form Response Sheets.

You can do it yourself using the code or if you need my assistance you can contact me.
